# Site Sound

Site Sound is a Firefox extension that lets you manually enable and control the audio volume for specific websites. It is intended for sites that do not already have their own volume control.

## What it does

- **Manual Per-Site Control:** The extension is off by default. You can enable it for any website using a simple toggle switch in the popup.
- **Remembers Your Settings:** Once enabled for a site, it saves both the enabled state and your chosen volume level for all future visits.
- **Simple Volume Slider:** When enabled, it provides a slider to control the volume (0–100%) for all audio and video elements on the current site.
- **Dynamic Content Support:** Automatically applies your volume setting to new audio or video elements, including those loaded as you scroll (like on Instagram).
- **Safe and Private:** Does not boost audio above 100%. All settings are stored locally in your browser.

## Usage

1. Click the Site Sound icon in your toolbar.
2. Use the toggle switch at the top to enable Site Sound for the current website.
3. Once enabled, use the slider to set your desired volume.
4. Your settings for this site will be saved for future visits.

## Notes

- Best on sites without their own volume slider.
- No boosting, only 0–100% volume.
- Minimal permissions required.
