# Site Sound

A Firefox extension to set and remember audio volume for each website.

## Features

- Adjust site audio from 0% to 100% (no boosting)
- Remembers your volume setting per website
- Simple popup with slider
- Automatically detects and disables itself on sites with native volume controls (e.g., YouTube, Twitch)
- Works on dynamically loaded media (e.g., Instagram videos)

## Usage

- Click the Site Sound icon in your toolbar.
- Use the slider to set the volume for the current site.
- If the site has its own volume control, Site Sound will let you know and stay out of the way.

## Notes

- No audio boosting: only 0–100% volume for safety and compatibility.
- Minimal permissions. Settings are saved per site automatically.
